1. The SDK should accept API KEY for OpenWeatherAPI on initialization
2. The SDK should accept the name of the city and return information about the weather at the current
moment. The SDK returns information about the first city which was found by searching for the city
name.
3. The SDK should store weather information about the requested cities and if it is relevant, return the
stored value (Weather is considered to be up to date if less than 10 minutes have passed)
4. In order to save memory, the SDK can store information for no more than 10 cities at a time.
5. The SDK should have two types of behavior: on-demand and polling mode. In on-demand mode the
SDK updates the weather information only on customer requests. In polling mode SDK requests new
weather information for all stored locations to have zero-latency response for customer requests.
Mode of the SDK should be passed as parameter on initialization.
6. The SDKâ€™s methods should throw an exception with a description of the reason in case of failure.
7. Advantage: design the process of creating the SDK so that you can work with different keys, while
creating two copies of an object with the same key is not possible. Also add a method to delete the
object.
8. Big advantage: having unit tests for SDK methods (use mocks for network requests)
